# Module 2 Final Project


## Introduction

In this project, I have analyzed a dataset from Kaggle to investigate the relationship between a game's success and its various features. 

## Questions to be answered:

- Should new game devs develop mobile games that are free to play or pay to play?
- If I choose to make a game pay to play, does it matter how expensive it is?
- Should I cater to a specific age group when developing mobile games?
- What are the most important features when developing a strategy game?
- What types of microtransactions should I focus on the most?

## Process:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Hypothesis Testing and Correlation
5. Modeling


## Conclusions:

- It is recommended to develop free-to-play apps, as they are shown to receive a lot more ratings, increasing the chances of having a well rated app.
- It is important to have a well-written description for the game, in order to both entice new users and to not overhype their expectations.
- It is better to have frequent updates to the game over slower, possibly bigger updates.
- Small sum in-app purchases, most specifically $0.99 options are likely the most profitable
